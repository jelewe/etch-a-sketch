# etch-a-sketch
This project was created as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">The Odin Project curriculum. </a> <br /> <br />
In this project, I utilized CSS Grid, FlexBox, JavaScript, and simple algorithms to create an 'etch-a-sketch' style drawing pad.
